Diabetes refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body
uses blood sugar(glucose).When we eat, our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas
is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow
us to use the glucose for energy.
High blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased
thirst, and increased hunger.
