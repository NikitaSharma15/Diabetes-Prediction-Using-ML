According to International Diabetes Federation 382
million people are living with Diabetes across the world wide. By 2035,this will be doubled as 592 million.
INDIA is at No.2 with an estimated 77 million people with diabetes(2nd highest in the world) CHINA is at No.1
with an estimated 160 million diabetes patients, which is very dangerous diseases and does not able to cure.

Diabetes refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body
uses blood sugar(glucose).When we eat, our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas
is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow
us to use the glucose for energy.
High blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased
thirst, and increased hunger. 

FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS :
● < 100 (up to 99) mg/dL - Normal
● Between from 100-125 mg/dL - Prediabetes
● > 126 mg/dL(or above) - Diabetes.

AFTER FOODING BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS :
● After two hours, < 140 mg/dL - Healthy
● Between from 140-199 mg/dL - Prediabetes
● After two hours, > 200 mg/dL(or above) -
Unhealthy or Diabetes.

Machine learning algorithms were analyzed using
Pima Indian diabetes dataset..They include the Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree, & Random Forest algorithms and the Logistic Algorithm turned
out to be the most effective one in all other
Algorithms in the study’s dataset.
